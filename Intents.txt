Explicit intents are used when you want to specify which activity will be handling your request. We have used these in programs such as our address books 
or todo lists where we want to specify the use of the add to array list service. Here is an example of an explicit intent that uses the AddToArrayListService class:

    Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, AddToArrayListService.class);
    bindService(intent, mConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);

Implicit intents are used when the acticity that will be handling the request is unknown. They will be used to perform a general action. For example, if 
you want to open a link in a browser, you wouldn't know which acticity this would be done through, so you would have to use an implicit intent like this one:

    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url));
    startActivity(intent);
